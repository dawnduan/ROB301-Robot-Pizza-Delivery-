# ROB301-Robot-Pizza-Delivery-

The final robot design project summarizes all the applications and knowledge exposed through the entire term and apply them into an actual robot that embedded with an objective and have the ability to sense and extract informations from the environment and act accordingly. The robots are equipped with a designed control system in order to perform the pizza delivery task. The mission of the robot is to deliver pizza to a destination that  is randomly chosen from a set of predefined locations based on the userâ€™s instruction. During the delivery process, robot must detect and avoid randomly placed obstacles. Then the robot are required to return to its initial pose after the pizza is delivered successfully.

In this design report, a detail illustration of overall structure and platform design of robots are presented. Moreover, explanations about design strategies in each components and analysis and justifications about the algorithm along with detail figures and flowcharts are provided. Furthermore, this report discusses and summarize the actual performance of the robot in the design demonstration and offer constructive suggestions on how to improve the performance of robots for future benefits.
